# Landing-Page
This is my third project encapsulating my newfound knowledge of flexbox, and its use in creating unique web pages. 

For this task I created a landing page themed around automobile news solely through flexbox layout. 

While difficult I was able to manipulate blocks of text into different subdivisions, each with their own flex properties. 

I also combined my knowledge of CSS to give the page divisions a style of their own, using background color, images, and buttons to display a variety of visual appeals to my page

Do note that the page layout is unable to collapse appropriately when minimizing the tab, nor is it compatible with other display types. This is a self note for me to improve on such!

Note to future self apply proper flex so elements collapse correctly
